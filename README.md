# ETARA-Hub
The ETARA Hub is a repository that provides several different categories of Web API configurations, e.g. for bibliographic APIs like CrossRef, for filmographic APIs like the Open Movie Database, more complex JSON response structures, API configurations that respond to request errors with an HTTP status code, and much more. More information about the ETARA Hub can be found [here](https://github.com/ETARA-Benchmark-System/.github/blob/main/profile/etara-hub.md).

We would like to encourage all users of the ETARA Benchmark System to add the API configurations developed for their own tests to the repository and make them available for other developers and researchers
